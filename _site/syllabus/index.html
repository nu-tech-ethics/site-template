    <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and will present new, 
        unexpected challenges to our class and to our community at Northwestern. 
        We want to acknowledge that things are difficult for many of us on multiple fronts. 
        Some thoughts:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Your health and well-being is always top priority. 
            Please communicate with us if you have something going 
            on so that we can figure out a path forward together.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are numerous resources at Northwestern that are in 
            place to support students with extenuating circumstances 
            (e.g. CAPS, talking to your academic advisor, talking to 
            the dean of students, etc.). We can help you navigate these 
            paths if you need help.
        </li>
    </ol>

<h3 id="TODO_prohibition-of-recording-of-class-sessions-by-students">Prohibition of Recording of Class Sessions by Students</h3>

<blockquote class="blockquote-no-margin">
  <p>Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact AccessibleNU. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings — including distributing or posting them — is also prohibited.</p>

  <p>Under the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials — including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations.  Students cannot copy, reproduce, display or distribute these materials.
